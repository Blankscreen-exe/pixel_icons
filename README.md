# My Pixel Icon Set

Free for all pixel icons, by yours truly. Use them however you like or may suggest some ideas for me to work on ... or better yet, you can contribute your own to the repo.

In case you are interested, I used Aesprite to create these. All of the icons here are 16x16 aspect ratio.

## How To Request For New Icons

Just submit an issue and I will see what I can do. Keep in mind that working on new ideas as soon as they come in is not feasible for me. So once the requests have piled up a bit, then I will start working on a whole new batch.
